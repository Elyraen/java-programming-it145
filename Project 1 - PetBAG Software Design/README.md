# Pet BAG Software Development (Global Rain)

This project was completed as part of my work with **Global Rain**, a software engineering company that designs and develops custom software for clients. As a junior developer on the team, I contributed to the **Pet Boarding and Grooming (Pet BAG)** project, which aims to replace inefficient paper-based processes with a modern application that manages **pet check-in** and **pet check-out** operations.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- **Client:** Pet Boarding and Grooming (Pet BAG)  
- **Company:** Global Rain  
- **Objective:** Develop a Java class and supporting documentation as part of the foundation for Pet BAGâ€™s new app.  
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Representing pets in code using a `Pet` class  
  - Writing pseudocode for one functional method (check-in or check-out)  
  - Designing a flowchart for the chosen method  
  - Explaining the use of OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction)  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- `Pet.java` â€” Java class file based on UML specifications  
- `summary_report.pdf` â€” Contains:
  - Pseudocode for **pet check-in** or **pet check-out**  
  - Flowchart of the chosen process  
  - OOP design explanation  
- `README.md` â€” This documentation file  

---

## ðŸ”§ Pet.java Class Features
- Attributes for `petType`, `petName`, `petAge`, `dogSpaces`, `catSpaces`, `daysStay`, and `amountDue`  
- Constructor (default and parameterized)  
- Accessors and mutators for all attributes  
- Inline comments for readability and maintainability  

---

## ðŸ“‘ Pseudocode & Flowchart
- **Pseudocode:** High-level step-by-step outline for either check-in or check-out process.  
- **Flowchart:** One-page diagram showing start, decisions, and end conditions for the chosen process.  

---

## ðŸ§  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
- **Encapsulation:** Attributes are private, accessed through getters and setters.  
- **Abstraction:** The `Pet` class models real-world pet information while hiding implementation details.  
- **Inheritance (planned):** Although this project focuses on the `Pet` class, the design allows for future extension into subclasses (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`).  
- **Maintainability:** Well-commented code ensures clarity for other developers and future iterations.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- Java (OpenJDK)  
- UML Diagrams  
- Flowcharting tool (Lucidchart, Draw.io, or hand-drawn)  
- Word processor for summary report

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the **early stages of object-oriented software development** for a real-world client. By translating UML diagrams into a working Java class, drafting pseudocode, and designing a flowchart, I contributed to Pet BAGâ€™s modernization effort while applying best practices in **OOP design and software documentation**.
