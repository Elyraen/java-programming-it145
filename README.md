# Foundational App Development - IT145

This repository contains my coursework and projects for **IT145: Found in App Development**.

---

## Course Overview

IT145 introduces fundamental programming concepts using Java, with an emphasis on problem-solving for business and engineering applications. The course focuses on writing logical, structured, and well-documented code, and developing key object-oriented programming skills.

The course is lab-intensive and provides hands-on experience in an integrated development environment (IDE). Instead of a single final project, students complete multiple smaller projects aligned with core competencies.

## Key Topics and Competencies

- Java programming fundamentals  
- Problem-solving techniques using programming  
- Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- Writing, reviewing, and documenting interactive applications  
- Using IDEs effectively for development and debugging

## Tools & Technologies

The course leverages tools including:

- **Java** – primary programming language  
- **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)** such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse  
- **Git** – version control for managing code revisions  

*Additional tools will be added as needed throughout the course.*
